# GnixUtils [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/akutz/gnixutils.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/akutz/gnixutils)

GnixUtils provides incomplete, portable versions of common *NIX commands
such as:
* cat
* cp
* curl
* date
* env
* grep
* mkdir
* mv
* rm
* sed
* tar
* touch

The implementations of many of the commands are still incomplete, but do
satisfy some of their more common usage patterns.
